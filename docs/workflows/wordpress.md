# WordPress Deployment & Playground Notes

Each workflow now has its own mini-guide. Replace `<LIGHTSAIL_IP>` and `<PATH_TO_PEM>` with your real values when running commands and keep them out of Git.

## Sections

- `docs/workflows/wordpress/filezilla.md` – SFTP configuration and theme folder paths.
- `docs/workflows/wordpress/playground.md` – Local Playground CLI server + blueprint link.
- `docs/workflows/wordpress/bitnami.md` – SSH access, permission fixes, and deploy flow.
- `docs/workflows/wordpress/phpmyadmin.md` – SSH tunneling to reach phpMyAdmin safely.
- `docs/workflows/wordpress/vscode-ssh.md` – configure VS Code Remote SSH to browse `/opt/bitnami/wordpress`.

Use this index to jump into the exact workflow you need without scanning a long document.

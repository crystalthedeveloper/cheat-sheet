# Cheat Sheet

Quick access to the workflows and snippets I reach for most often. Everything now
lives inside `docs/` so GitHub renders it cleanly and it is easy to skim from the
sidebar.

## Directory Map

- `docs/backend/django` – Pipenv setup, package lists, database backends, MySQL notes.
- `docs/frontend/react` – npm pointers plus Stripe metadata formatting tips.
- `docs/webflow` – webflow workflow plus JS/CSS/HTML snippets in `snippets/`.
- `docs/workflows` – Git commands plus WordPress deployment/playground notes.

Add more cheats by dropping Markdown or snippet files under `docs/` and letting
GitHub's built-in file viewer do the heavy lifting.
